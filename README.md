## Hi, I'm Frances Ugwu 👋

I'm a final-year Computer Engineering student passionate about building real-world systems at the intersection of **Embedded Systems, Edge AI, and Autonomous Robotics**.  
My long-term goal is to become a top-tier engineer and researcher, and eventually build a tech company solving difficult, high-impact problems.
